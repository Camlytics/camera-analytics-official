## Getting Started

To start Camlytics, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary packages through running `npm install` in the frontend and the backend folders. 

- Start the Camlytics API by running `FLASK_APP=api.py flask run` in the backend folder. 
- Start the detector: `cd` into the detector folder (in backend) and run `python detector.py`. 
- Start the React frontend: `cd` into the frontend folder and run `npm start`. You should then have a local Camlytics server running at `http://localhost:3000`.
